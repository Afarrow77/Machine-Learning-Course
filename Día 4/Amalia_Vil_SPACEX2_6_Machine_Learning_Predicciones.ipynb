        "Space X anuncia en su página web lanzamientos de cohetes Falcon 9 con un coste de 62 millones de dólares; otros proveedores cuestan más de 165 millones de dólares cada uno, gran parte del ahorro se debe a que Space X puede reutilizar la primera etapa. Por lo tanto, si podemos determinar si la primera etapa aterrizará, podemos determinar el coste de un lanzamiento. Esta información puede utilizarse si una empresa alternativa quiere pujar contra Space X por el lanzamiento de un cohete.   En este laboratorio, crearás una línea de aprendizaje automático para predecir si la primera etapa aterrizará dados los datos de los laboratorios anteriores."
